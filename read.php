        <p style="width: 340px;">To apply for a bursary in Kenya, applicants must demonstrate financial need and, in many cases, belong to a vulnerable group such as orphans or children with disabilities. Admission to an accredited public institution, such as a secondary school or university, is typically required. Applicants must provide supporting documents, including their admission letter, fee structure, birth certificate, and academic reports. Some programs, like the Presidential Secondary School Bursary (PSSB), may require a minimum score (e.g., 250 marks in KCPE) and evidence of orphan status through death certificates. Additionally, verification from local community leaders and signed declaratio
            ns by the applicant and guardians are often required to confirm the accuracy of submitted information â€‹</p>
